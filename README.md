Q2) Central Theme: Erik Satie.

Q3) On the Petrucci Music Library, known by the acronym [IMSLP](https://www.imslp.org/), Satie's works are collated as Compositions, Collections and As Dedicatee. Furthermore, choosing one of their sub-options will take you to recordings, scores and MIDI files of the piece selected.

## *Week 2*
